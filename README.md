# Tuples-Collections-module-13
Homework. Module 13 - tuples and collections.

## Full text of the assignment:
1. Create a tuple for two people with the same data types and parameters. At the same time, get some values by index, and others by parameter.
2. Create an array "days in months" (12 elements containing the number of days in the corresponding month). 
Using a for loop and this array:
* print the number of days in each month
* use another array with month names to display month name + number of days
* do the same, but using an array of tuples with parameters (month name, number of days)
* do the same, just print the days in reverse order (the order in the original array does not change)
* for an arbitrarily chosen date (month and day) count the number of days until the end of the year
3. Create a dictionary like a student journal, where the student's first and last name is the key and the exam grade is the value.
Increase your student's exam grade
If the score is positive (4 or 5) or satisfactory (3), then display a message with congratulations, negative (1, 2) - send it for retake
Add a few more students - these will be new classmates!
Delete one student - he is expelled
Calculate the average score of the entire group at the end of the exam.
